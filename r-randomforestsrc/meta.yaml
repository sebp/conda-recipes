  summary: A unified treatment of Breiman's random forests for survival, regression and classification
    problems based on Ishwaran and Kogalur's random survival forests (RSF) package.  The
    package runs in both serial and parallel (OpenMP) modes. Now extended to include
    multivariate and unsupervised forests.
